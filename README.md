# IfoodDevWeek2023
>Repository status: Finish

A project developed during Ifood DevWeek 2023, an immersion of DIO in partnership with Ifood. 

The project is about Data Science with AI (Artificial Intelligence) and a little of Machine Learning, beyond the basics tools of the area as Pandas and Matplotlib. 

I changed somethings in the code that I thought were more interesting, in relation to the code developed during the Ifood DevWeek week, I exchanges some names of variables and classes and embedded some functions as methods of this classes.
